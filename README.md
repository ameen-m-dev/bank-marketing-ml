# Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing data from a Portuguese bank.

## Project Structure
- `regression.ipynb`: Logistic Regression model
- `decision_tree.ipynb`: Decision Tree model
- `trainset.csv`: Training data
- `testset.csv`: Test data
- `Report.pdf`: Full project report with methodology and evaluation

## Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing (feature selection, SMOTE)
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classification
- Model evaluation using F1 score and accuracy

## Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: **92%**
- Decision Tree Accuracy: **94%**
- Decision Tree showed better F1 performance on imbalanced data

## Dataset
The dataset is from a Portuguese bank's marketing campaign, predicting client responses to term deposit offers. The data includes demographic, contact, and campaign-related information.
